Fail daemon
Automatic failure detection daemon.

Building ... make.

Running.

faild requires a number of environment variables to run.  When
installing from pacakges, the defaults all work and should be fine.
When running in a development environment you will probably have to
change a few things.

faild defaults file.  Normally, when faild runs from packages, the
monitor loads the defaults file from /etc/default/untangle-faild
first, and then begins running.  The defaults file setups a number of
configuration parameters.  To ease development, there is a sample 
defaults file which should allow you to run by simply building the
binary and then running
FAILD_DEFAULTS_SCRIPT=./untangle-faild ./files/usr/share/untangle-faild/bin/monitor.faild


For more information about all of the environment variables, you
should read over the defaults file untangle-faild.

## FAILD user
faild is designed to run as an unprivileged user.  You
should grant sudo access to any of the operations that may fail when
running as faild.  Everything that currently falls into that bucket is
automatically granted if you install the untangle-faild package.
