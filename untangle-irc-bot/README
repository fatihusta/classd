Thanks are owed to the infobot developers - several of rbot's features are
inspired by infobot and so are some of the default plugins. Thanks are also
owed to RADKade1, as rbot's quote plugin is a direct reimplementation of his
"quotesaq" - simply because it's a great quote interface.

Mainly, rbot's fun to play with, although the plugin architecture can be used
to write very useful modules
