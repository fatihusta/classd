/**
 * Lock is a simple (pthread_rwlock,thread_id) tuple.
 * This gives several advantages.
 * You can see who the owner is, and also sometimes prevent deadlocks
 *
 * There are two modes, keeping track of the readers and not keep track
 * If you specify keeping track of the readers a hash table will be used
 * with slight overhead, but will catch the following deadlocks:
 * calling wrlock() when you hold a read lock
 * calling rdlock() when you hold a write lock
 * also calling unlock() on a lock you don't rd own will return an error
 *
 * When not keeping track of the readers, those conditions will not be detected.
 *
 * All other behavior is inherited from pthread_rwlock
