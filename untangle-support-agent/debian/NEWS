rbot (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New configuration file:
    'conf.rbot' has been replaced by 'conf.yaml', which is more manageable,
    allowing on the fly configuration modifications using the "config"
    command (see: help config). You need to run the bot interractively
    the first time after upgrading, then a wizard will ask you questions
    to fill the necessary minimal parameters into the initial 'conf.yaml'
    file. Rbot may not guess the right directory (mostly if you use SU),
    so you're advised to specify the config directory in the command line.

  * Plugin directory has changed:
    plugins used to be in '/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rbot/plugins', and now live
    in '/usr/share/rbot/plugins', so you need to move your custom
    system-wide plugins manually.

  * New plugins :
    + autoop
    + opme
    + quakeauth: Q auth on Quakenet network
    + roshambo: rock-paper-scissors game
    + tube: London Tube transport information
